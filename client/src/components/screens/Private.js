					<h2 className="color-adjust-orange">Security Of Data</h2>
						<p>
						The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of 
						transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
						While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal

					<h2 className="color-adjust-orange">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
						<p>
						We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
						 We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
						</p>
						<p>
						We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior
						to the change becoming effective and update the “effective date” at the top of this
						 Privacy Policy.
						</p>

						You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
					     Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

					<h2 className="color-adjust-orange">Ads Display</h2>
						<p>
						The Physics Classroom displays ads on most of its pages. The ads are part of the Google Adsense program. We make no individual decisions regarding what ads display on a particular page for a particular student. All such decisions are governed by Google.
						</p>
						<p>
						We have a limited amount of control over which ads or what type of companies can display ads upon our website. We do exercise such control in an effort to prevent ads with objectionable content from displaying. There are entire categories of ads which should never appear on our screen because we have disabled such categories. For instance, advertisements for alcohol, tobacco products, lingerie, etc. should never appear on our pages since we have disabled these categories. We are also able to block ads that link to particular websites that might be considered objectionable and we do exercise such ablities to block ads. When we hear from teachers or parents about an objectionable ad, we use access to our Adsense account to locate the ads and block them. 
						</p>
						<p>
						It is important that users of our website recognize the importance of the Adsense program to our ongoing operations. It is one of our main sources of revenue and without it we would never be able to support the work of programmers and content providers nor pay for servers, content management systems, and other costs incurred on an annual basis. The implementation of the Adsense program allows us to provide a FREE website that serves many millions of students every year. While the above practices do not guarantee the display of unobjectionable ad content, we pledge to be vigilant about the ad content that displays on our website in order to keep all content appropriate. We are always appreciative of reports from parents and teachers to help us remain faithful to this pledge.
